Matters needing attention:

1.when the English version is used on the English system, please ensure that the software path does not have Chinese characters.

2.Serial port 2 for communication with the PLC, when the delivery equipment with sub file control box or PLC control cabinet, can be sub file down, so the device test communication serial port, do not plug in the serial 2.

3.due to different environment, test software will appear open problems on some systems, if not open, please install the vcredist_x86 plug-in under the plugins folder. The installation method is the regular installation method. Just click "next" until the installation is complete.
